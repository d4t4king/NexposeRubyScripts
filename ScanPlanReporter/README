= Overview
================================================

ScanPlanReporter is a tool to look at your scan schedule and help
you determine the results of each site's last scan, and plan
future scans.  It is particularly helpful for determining:
* Did my last scans complete successfully? (Right now, Nexpose's
  GUI shows scans that were stopped as having completed, so
  ScanPlanReporter helps you find the real results.)
* How long did the last scans take?
* What scanners is each site using? (Helpful to manually
  balance the load)

As of June 10, 2013, ScanPlanReporter has been updated to
work with Ruby 2.0.0 and Nexpose 0.2.6.

================================================
= How to run ScanPlanReporter
================================================

Run:
ruby ScanPlanReporter.rb

ScanPlanReporter will ask a few questions first:
* What is the name of your Nexpose console server
* What port are you using (default for Nexpose is 3780)
* ID and password to use to log in
* File to save the results in.

= To do
================================================

I have not yet built in the next scan info.  This is well covered 
by the Nexpose GUI in the Schedule Calendar, so there is little 
reason to implement it here.
