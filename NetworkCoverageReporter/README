NetworkCoverageReporter is a tool to help you determine if you
have configured Nexpose to cover your full network, and to
help detect any duplication

= How to run NetworkCoverageReporter
================================================

Run:
ruby NetworkCoverageReporter.rb

NetworkCoverageReporter will ask a few questions first:
* What is the name of your Nexpose console server
* What port are you using (default for Nexpose is 3780)
* ID and password to use to log in
* File to save the results in.
