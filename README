These ruby scripts build upon the Nexpose GEM to help Nexpose administrators manage their Nexpose environments.  Each script is independent of others, unless otherwise noted.

Each script has its own directory, with a README in that directory.

These scripts make use of ruby gems and assume you know how to get and install them.  If you don't, here is a starter:
1. Go to http://rubygems.org/gems/nexpose to get the Nexpose Ruby Gem.
2. At your command line, run:
  gem install nexpose

I am a Perl programmer, and this is my first foray into Ruby.  It is probably obvious in the code!  Over time, I expect the coding style to improve, but it is pretty scrappy for now. Feel free to offer bug fixes and stylistic improvements!
